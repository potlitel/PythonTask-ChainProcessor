# ChainProcessor

ChainProcessor is a software that calculates the weighting of the chains obtained in a file (chains.txt), taking into account the following previously defined rules:

## Installation
Before using ChainProcessor.py we must make sure that we have some version of python installed on our workstation, for this we execute the following command:

In case you don't have any version of python installed, use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install it by running the following command:

```bash
pip install python3
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
